00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,520
Steven D Kelley: Hello everyone.
Welcome to the show. My name is

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,800
Steven D Kelley. This is the
Steven D Kelley show.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,260
It's Thursday, once again, it's
November 13. Oh, I gotta set the

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,280
microphone down, getting

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:12,960
the noises.

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,740
It's November 13. 1113,

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,680
it's now 6:03pm. 2025

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,620
title, The Tonight Show. This
just came to me a little while

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,940
ago. I love how that always
happens, is sins of a father,

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,280
and that'll make more sense as
we go along.

11
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,940
And I'd like to say that I'm
excited to be here, but I can

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,840
never tell anymore if it's
excitement or anger, or what a

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,720
combination thereof and and I'll
tell you sometimes stuff hits me

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,800
that, you know, I already knew,
but when it hits me in the face

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,580
with like, you know that proof
thing that that give me a link,

16
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,400
thing that people are always
asking for. Like, there it is.

17
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,580
There it is in writing. There's
the smoking gun, there's the

18
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,380
proof. There's the footprints,
the fingerprints, whatever it is

19
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,280
that you need to prove things.
There it is. Now,

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,700
you know, honestly,

21
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,340
I've, I've had the, I don't know
if you want to call it a curse

22
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,420
of the blessing of kind of
knowing stuff that I'm not

23
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,380
supposed to know. I have no
reason to know. I just know, and

24
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,080
I guess that's what, that's what
being psychic is all about, is

25
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,200
that you just know stuff, and
you don't really have any reason

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,440
to know it. And sometimes you
know stuff, and you try to share

27
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,080
that with people, and it really
bothers those people, until, of

28
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,520
course, it comes out to be true.
You know, if you know what I

29
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,160
mean, I mean I'm talking petty
stuff, you know, like

30
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,960
relationships at home and bad
decisions people are going to

31
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,180
make, you say, Oh, you better
not do that, you know. And then,

32
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,020
of course, it's like, I used to
have a saying, it sucks being

33
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,800
right all the time,

34
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,420
but I'll tell you this, this
Getty stuff though, this whole

35
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,180
saving the world business, and
this whole fighting against

36
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,260
satanist and all that about,
first of all, before I go any

37
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,180
further, shout out to the guys
over there in tin hat

38
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,160
tin foil hat,

39
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:13,920
not the small not to be confused
with the small hat gang, but the

40
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,940
so where was I? Oh yeah, the

41
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,180
tin foil hat gang. No,

42
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,240
fighting these satanist stuff.

43
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,520
You know, I broke my program a
long time ago. I'll tell you

44
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,000
that. But

45
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,885
the thing is, is that, uh,

46
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,760
well,

47
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:35,060
when the time comes, and I think
it's coming really soon,

48
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,000
because, like I said, the
smoking guns are starting to be

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,640
uncovered. And, you know, like
the Epstein thing and the Trump,

50
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,380
the Trump pedophilia thing and
the Intertel mafia thing. It's

51
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,440
just not going away. And of
course, then there's the whole

52
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,260
Occupy the Getty thing and
Gordon Getty, and it's been

53
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,445
difficult to tie all this stuff
in together. And of course, when

54
00:02:55,445 --> 00:02:57,485
you're psychic, you don't really
need to, because you already

55
00:02:57,485 --> 00:03:00,785
know it's like, it's like,
connecting all the dots. I don't

56
00:03:00,785 --> 00:03:03,245
need to connect all the dots. I
already know where all the dots

57
00:03:03,245 --> 00:03:06,485
go. I've seen I've know the
path. It's kind of like

58
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:10,685
electricity. When you understand
Saturn, and you understand the

59
00:03:10,685 --> 00:03:13,925
true nature of electricity, you
understand it. It already knows

60
00:03:13,925 --> 00:03:17,930
where it's going a long time
before it travels down the wire,

61
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:21,470
crazy stuff. But that's way
beyond the scope of normal

62
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,610
humans, much like this whole
business with this whole saving

63
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,910
the world crap and this whole
corrupting the world crap. And,

64
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,150
you know, Satanism in general,
we like to think we understand

65
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,050
it, but we don't. And I'll tell
you, me personally, even though

66
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:40,190
I have all this personal
experience and insight, and, you

67
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,735
know, changing programming,

68
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:47,680
you know, actual, actual hands
on involvement. It still took me

69
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,260
a long time to figure a lot of
things out. Hell, it took me

70
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,140
five years to figure out that
the CIA that I was working for

71
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,320
was actually the NSA, but was
actually the NSA, the Oliver

72
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,260
North gang. It took me another
20 years to figure out it was

73
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,720
intertel and all that business
and and the whole Don Nixon,

74
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,760
Robert Vesco mafia business. I
mean, my God, just figuring out

75
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,460
it was all mafia took a long
time, and basically what that

76
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,720
tells me is that

77
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,960
I'm 20 years behind them.

78
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,040
It takes me a little while

79
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,460
to connect my dots, to figure
out what's going on that I'm

80
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,220
sharing with you, this stuff I'm
sharing with you about the Getty

81
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,680
and everything like that. That
took me a while to put it

82
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,620
together. And as I've been
traveling down this path now for

83
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,280
a good 20 something years, or
whatever it is, since I you

84
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,320
know, from 1990 or 2000 whenever
you want us consider it having

85
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,180
started 87 if you want to go
back to that far. But I guess it

86
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,780
got, it got really, you know,
Oliver North stuff that was 2000

87
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,640
you know, and, or no, was that?
No, that was 1990 then, of

88
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,820
course, the Getty stuff was like
2000 so it's like, when do you

89
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,920
want? It was been real the whole
time.

90
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,260
Yeah, but even then I was naive,
and I was just floundering in

91
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,460
there, like some sort of,

92
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,680
well average guy, like I like to
claim to be

93
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,140
immersed in this underworld of
wicked activity. And it took,

94
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,140
it's constantly taking me this
long to understand it, but I

95
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,160
realize now,

96
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,260
after so many years of trying to
share this information with you

97
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,760
guys and trying to get you guys
to respond and trying to make

98
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,940
changes, you know, positive
changes, with using based on the

99
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,580
stuff that I'm trying to share
with you, I realize that you're

100
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,960
like 20 years behind me,

101
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,400
and your best tool that you've
got was good 20 years behind the

102
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,500
enemy. That tells you what's
what we're looking at. It's

103
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,220
probably more like 50 years,
okay, whatever it is that we

104
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,760
know, or we think we know, or
what we're beginning to figure

105
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:57,820
out, is a good 50 years beyond
what they've been doing. They're

106
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,440
ahead of us that much. And
that's about, right? I mean, in

107
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,940
a typical satanic scenario, like
your typical protocols of the

108
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:11,940
learned elderness of Zion, type
of policy making, you're looking

109
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,640
at hundreds of years of policy
development. But the humans that

110
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,680
are running our situation on
Earth right now. They operate in

111
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,460
frames of about 50 years, and it
takes us about that long to

112
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,000
figure it out, but, but I'll
tell you, I figured it out.

113
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,840
Okay, this Getty thing. I don't
need to know all the stuff, but

114
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,900
I figured it out. I knew it was
bad this minute. I drove past

115
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,420
the place on the freeway. I knew
it was a big deal, and there was

116
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,200
something seriously wrong with
it. I didn't need the answers. I

117
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,940
just knew. I didn't know why.
Eventually I would learn the why

118
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,480
was because the entire stake of
the world and lives of billions

119
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,120
of people were at stake, and
that this was basically the root

120
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,780
of all Satanism on Earth, as far
as I was concerned. Well, you

121
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,340
know, if you want to consider
the Magna Carta and the throne

122
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,820
of the leaders of the Magna
Carta, you know, important,

123
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,620
sure, little hats Nazis aside, I
don't need to get into all that,

124
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,520
but I do know one thing for
sure. And I do know that from

125
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,700
their own mouth, they told me,
this is the answer. This is

126
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,640
their weak spot. This is how I
personally take them down

127
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,940
forever, and there's nothing
they can do about it to stop me.

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,380
And I don't need to know all the
details, but

129
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,440
we can share some of the details
now, before I try to get in

130
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,140
these details, because I want to
get into the latest revelations

131
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,720
coming out that basically
connect.

132
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,280
Gordon, Getty, Epstein and
Trump.

133
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,380
But before I do that, as long as
I don't lose my brain somewhere

134
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,080
between now and that, I just
want to say that I'm I'm

135
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,220
disgusted. I really am
disgusted. It's hard for me to

136
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,200
do this. I mean, let alone my
own personal inconveniences and

137
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,400
and tribulations and dramas and
what have you, and the fact that

138
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,340
I'm so darn tired of life in
general, because I've devoted

139
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,060
the best part of my life to this
mission and given up everything

140
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,420
I've earned and worked so hard
for, including my family,

141
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,360
friends, reputation, etc, and on
and on and on and on, not least

142
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,320
of which was All the money and
worldly conveniences and

143
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,980
material goods. Yeah, that I
gave up. Yeah, all my damn guns.

144
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,160
So hello, hello, you guys. I
know you don't have any idea

145
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,440
what I'm talking about, but
there was a lot of guns and

146
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,000
everything else.

147
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:33,680
But

148
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,420
it's not the,

149
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,680
you know, I mean, as a warrior,
obviously, I, I that's not the

150
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,360
part that bothers me. Okay,
sure, the the ongoing pain of

151
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,320
having, of the of the loss and
the sacrifices, is forever.

152
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,560
Okay, you can't fix that. You
can't give me back my life and

153
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,800
my family and my youth and my
money and all that stuff. You

154
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,860
just can't do it. My My
children, watching my children

155
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,860
grow up. Can't do that. Okay, so
the only thing I have left, of

156
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,960
course, is defeating this enemy.
And apparently that's

157
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,540
that's probably why it's going
to be successful. They are going

158
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,500
to get defeated.

159
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,660
But beyond the discussed part

160
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,400
before I get into the stuff that
talking about Trump and now

161
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,480
Trump, Trump is a disgusting
person, and apparently Gordon

162
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,240
Getty thinks so too. Gordon
Getty is still alive.

163
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,160
Now,

164
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,860
to preface this, I'll just say
that I was inside of Gordon

165
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,280
Getty's house, and the house
that I was in was the one that

166
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,200
he shared with his mistress, the
Beck woman over there in, I

167
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,060
don't know, some part of La
Hollywood area, ritzy, ritzy

168
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,740
part, I'm sure. But either way,

169
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,320
when his

170
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,800
second marriage became public.

171
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,520
They vacated the premises and
left it vacant. And I was led to

172
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,660
it by somebody who basically
discovered it with psychics kill

173
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,180
because we did. It's not the
sort of thing they advertised.

174
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:15,140
But anyway, she stumbled upon
it, and she said, Hey, let's go

175
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,660
check this house out. low and
behold, it was Gordon Getty's

176
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,140
fucking house.

177
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:23,000
Neither one of us had a clue
anyway, so while I was in there,

178
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,840
rummaging through what was left
behind, which was pretty much

179
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,380
everything,

180
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,240
I mean a lot.

181
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,840
Kendalle, if you're listening,
I've got some of your stuff. I

182
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:38,300
got one of your your photos of
your dad with with Judge Newsom

183
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,020
at Yosemite, and I swear I want
to pick up some of your little

184
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,260
childhood mementos, like your
little pottery pop projects you

185
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,020
made at school and stuff. There
was this one little clay box I

186
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,300
saw that I thought was cool. I
wanted to share it. Save it for

187
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,345
you, because I'm sure it was you
regret having to leave that

188
00:10:53,345 --> 00:10:55,745
stuff behind, and I feel sorry
for you. But

189
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,100
while I was rummaging through
Gordon Getty's house, I didn't

190
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,860
just find empty coke bottles and
snuff porn and the craziest ass

191
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,880
video, VHS videos. You can
imagine that he was probably

192
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,760
having weird, kinky sex to one
on coke. Seriously, the guy was

193
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,540
sick, if you just judging by the
porn the videos that he left

194
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,640
behind. But he left behind a lot
of documents, tons and tons and

195
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,660
tons of documents, paperwork
everywhere. Okay? And I read

196
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,340
some of this paperwork. A lot of
it

197
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,860
was stuff that he sent out to so
called world leaders, Gordon

198
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,440
Getty, from the desk of Gordon
Getty type stuff, talking to

199
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,800
some president of such and such,
Premier of this and that,

200
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,420
offering some advice on some
sort of geopolitical situation.

201
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,880
You're thinking, What the hell
is Gordon Getty offering advice

202
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,640
these people about anything, and
usually this stuff was really

203
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,100
bizarre, complex, socio
political, human crap. Okay,

204
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,940
very strange half the time. And
I think again, what the hell is

205
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,900
this Gordon Getty? Think he is?
And why in the hell would these

206
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,340
people listen to him?

207
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,160
Never made sense to me.

208
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,300
But, you know, at the time, I
didn't understand the club.

209
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,080
Okay, I didn't understand the
club. So why would I understand

210
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,440
that?

211
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,100
Well, something came out

212
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,260
as a result of a

213
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,660
House committee. No, I don't
know the details, because I know

214
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,780
everything in Washington is
bullshit. And before I go any

215
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,300
further, I want to say something
that I know,

216
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:35,840
Ed, this is kind of for you, but
I just want to say to all of you

217
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,720
out there that are working for
this government, this so called

218
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,320
government,

219
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,880
it's nothing more than a mafia
right now, whatever the

220
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,300
institution was, it no longer
is, because it has been usurped

221
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:52,360
by mafia powers and it is no
longer valid, and your laws and

222
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,200
your constitution, everything
else have been usurped. You

223
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,540
don't just fuck the Queen and
make Rothschild babies and claim

224
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,300
the throne in this country. No,
it doesn't work like that. You

225
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,700
can take your mafia shit and
shove it up your ass. But the

226
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,880
point is, speaking of ass,
you're going to be kissing a lot

227
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,240
of it. Because all of you
motherfuckers, when you don't

228
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,180
die, when you don't get your
head cut off, and your time is

229
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,140
coming soon, you're going to be
kissing my ass in a serious

230
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,020
fashion, motherfuckers,

231
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,560
I can guarantee you that.

232
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,000
So you need to think twice about
what you do in the future,

233
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:33,440
because if I have the FBI, next
time I have the FBI pussies show

234
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,320
up at my door to try to
intimidate me,

235
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,160
I would love to see them try to
do something it doesn't fucking

236
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,960
matter anymore, because you know
what I knew before anybody. I

237
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,320
know your whole damn fucking
game. There's nothing you can

238
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,560
do. I know every single fucking
thing I've got dirt on every

239
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,600
single motherfucking one of you.

240
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:59,080
And the damn emails and texts
and connections are starting to

241
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,500
come out now. Anyway, here's
this one that just came out.

242
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,460
Now, of course, the media is
going to try to spin it in such

243
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,720
a way that they can make it
political. Okay, it's kind of

244
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,380
like be the way Donald Trump has
been protecting himself against

245
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,380
the Epstein files coming out
saying now the, of course, the

246
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,680
Democrats are saying that the
GOP means the guardians of

247
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,180
pedophilia, you know, which is
a, course, a connection to the

248
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,840
Guardians of the Galaxy movie.
So guardians of pedophilia? Yes,

249
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,780
they're all the guardians of
pedophilia. Everything they do

250
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,680
right now isn't just about
genocide and promoting Israel,

251
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,220
which of course, has a lot to do
with pedophilia and stealing oil

252
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,620
and making money and putting
gold all over the White House

253
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,160
and tearing down the east wing.
No, no,

254
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,920
It's about defending themselves
against Epstein. Now, now here's

255
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,600
the thing, and I've been trying
to tell you guys this for a long

256
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,060
time, but Trump is a little fish
in this game. Sure. He was a big

257
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:00,080
shot with the Intertel Mafia. He
was the man that.

258
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,080
Man there was a CEO of Resorts
International after Robert Vesco

259
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,540
died, and you would think that
would put him right up there

260
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:11,220
with Robert Vesco. Apparently,
it was not, because, apparently

261
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:16,260
there is another man who is the
real granddaddy of this shit, as

262
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,080
I've been trying to tell you for
all this time, and his name is

263
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,580
Gordon fucking Getty.

264
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,220
Now the Jewish Nazi, of course,
is Alan Dershowitz. Now, to

265
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,920
understand the concept of Jewish
Nazi, of course, you have to

266
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,860
understand the Chabad Jews. And
I've been trying to get these

267
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,220
people through, through your
head that these mafioso people

268
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,360
are Jewish Nazis, this Epstein
clown, this Alan Dershowitz guy,

269
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,600
this is the Jewish Nazi. The
same thing the Gordon Getty.

270
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,980
They're all really Jewish Nazis.

271
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:42,879
So they're talking about their
own club here, Jewish Nazi club,

272
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:47,739
and they're saying that Donald
Trump is a narcissistic

273
00:18:47,739 --> 00:18:53,619
psychopath. Okay, like it's
known this is high importance to

274
00:18:53,619 --> 00:18:57,639
these guys. So let me see. What
else is there? Okay, here it is.

275
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:03,539
Let me see if I can give you the
course I've got the media, of

276
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:06,239
course, they're going to try to
reword this. They go in messages

277
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:11,759
obtained by a House committee.
Epstein corresponded with Robert

278
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,479
Trivers, an American
evolutionary biologist, a

279
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:22,879
eugenicist, about a theory put
forward by Gordon Getty, an

280
00:19:22,879 --> 00:19:27,019
influential businessman, not
just an influential businessman,

281
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:34,699
but their godfather, their
spiritual leader, that Mr. Trump

282
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:42,219
is quote psychopath or sociopath
or malignant narcissist, and

283
00:19:42,219 --> 00:19:46,179
must be opposed with full force
on that basis, unquote.

284
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:53,500
So accordingly, Jeffrey Epstein
responds, and supposedly he's

285
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,760
responding to Robert Trivers,
and he says, I think you might

286
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:04,780
be missing the benefit of. Of
the psychopath to the group. He

287
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:10,720
is the defender, easily
sacrificed, but strikes fear in

288
00:20:10,765 --> 00:20:16,885
the heart of other tribes. They
are needed as best warriors. Now

289
00:20:16,885 --> 00:20:20,365
to understand this, you have to
understand the Old Testament.

290
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:23,185
You have to read the Old
Testament, because if you

291
00:20:23,185 --> 00:20:27,985
understand that, you'll know
that the Israelites had a a long

292
00:20:27,985 --> 00:20:33,850
history of making a low life
criminal their leader, because

293
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,850
they figured that this low life
criminal would scare the shit

294
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,910
out of their enemies and do the
unspeakable things that needed

295
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,850
to be done to defend them.
There's a long history of this

296
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:51,490
sort of thing, so you might be
missing the benefit of the

297
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:56,455
psychopath to the group. So in
other words, it's a group. They

298
00:20:56,455 --> 00:21:01,795
are all part of a group, right
there. It says that Jeffrey

299
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:07,195
Epstein, this other guy, this
eugenicist, these Jewish Nazis

300
00:21:09,595 --> 00:21:18,595
with Gordon Getty, is their
godfather. Leader. Is a group, a

301
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:22,060
very strange group that, yes,
what I found out should not just

302
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:30,400
be Zionist Jews, but Nazis,
through and through, at the same

303
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,840
time, operating side by side,
dual polarities, like we

304
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:41,320
discussed in the last show. So
he's has a benefit, because he's

305
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,685
a defender. He's defending them
from their stuff. He will, He

306
00:21:45,685 --> 00:21:49,465
will kill everybody to defend
the world from the truth about

307
00:21:49,465 --> 00:22:00,865
Epstein. And he's easily
sacrificed. They can toss him

308
00:22:00,865 --> 00:22:04,810
under the bus anytime they want,
because they control him. They

309
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:10,330
have dirt on him. Epstein has
anything he needs to bring him

310
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:15,490
down. Mossad Netanyahu has
everything they need to be bring

311
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:20,470
him down. He says so right here
in 20 fucking 12 or whatever the

312
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:26,350
hell it is. But he strikes fear
in the heart of other tribes,

313
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:31,555
other tribes. There's that tribe
bullshit mentality. Who are

314
00:22:31,555 --> 00:22:37,435
they? They are the tribe. They
are still fighting other tribes,

315
00:22:37,435 --> 00:22:43,075
like the amaleks. Us, the ones
they want to genocide. We are

316
00:22:43,075 --> 00:22:47,455
just another tribe that their
God says should be genocided,

317
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,860
and they need Trump as their
best lawyer. They need that a

318
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:58,600
disgusting piece of shit, Trump.
I didn't even want to do a show

319
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:06,100
because I'm so sick of saying
how disgusting Trump is and how

320
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:13,000
disgusted I am that so many
people still trust him, so many

321
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,665
people still listen to him. He's
a fucking pedophile. He's

322
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:22,225
committed incest. He is a coke
head. He does everything

323
00:23:22,225 --> 00:23:26,005
possible you could fucking
imagine. He killed little boys

324
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:31,585
and little girls. He's a
horrible person. His entire

325
00:23:31,585 --> 00:23:38,230
business empire is based on lies
and deception, money laundering,

326
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:47,110
deceit, Mafia activity. He
didn't make anything. He is

327
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:53,050
nothing but added value. And the
only thing he made was those

328
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:57,010
buildings, and he had to tear
down better structures to make

329
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:03,175
those things. And he used mafia
to make it, and he buried his

330
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:09,055
victims in the foundation with
the cement and concrete poured

331
00:24:09,055 --> 00:24:14,335
by the mafia, the same mafia
that he was a part of. And yet

332
00:24:15,115 --> 00:24:18,355
he runs our government, and yet
we have Kash Patel telling

333
00:24:18,355 --> 00:24:22,540
people this so called pussy Kash
Patel that will send fucking FBI

334
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,300
to my door because of the
treasonous things I'm saying

335
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:29,140
about this bullshit mafia
fucking country, fuck Israel.

336
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,580
He's actually suing some
YouTuber, supposedly, or

337
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:39,160
whatever, because he was calling
his honey pot girlfriend,

338
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,780
Mossad. Yet he didn't even call
the girlfriend, Mossad.

339
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,525
Apparently, the lawsuit says
that he didn't even say that. He

340
00:24:46,525 --> 00:24:49,765
said that he was just basically
saying bad things about Israel.

341
00:24:49,765 --> 00:24:55,105
So now saying bad things about
Israel means that fucking Kash

342
00:24:55,105 --> 00:24:59,305
Patel is going to sue you for 5
million fucking dollars. It's

343
00:24:59,305 --> 00:25:02,305
fucking clown. World, if you're
not disgusted, there's something

344
00:25:02,305 --> 00:25:07,285
wrong with you, if you're taking
their fucking money in the form

345
00:25:07,285 --> 00:25:10,630
of a paycheck, and look, you're
looking the other way, and

346
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:14,110
you're so worried about your own
reputation and your mortgage and

347
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:17,830
your food and your children and
your livelihood, if you're so

348
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:21,010
worried about it that you will
continue to do whatever the fuck

349
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:25,150
needs to be done just to get by
so they don't fucking take all

350
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:28,390
your money away like they're
going to do to everybody in a

351
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:33,190
heartbeat as soon as our digital
ID system becomes worldwide. My

352
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:39,595
God, everything I've said is
correct, everything a photograph

353
00:25:39,595 --> 00:25:47,395
of Jeffrey Epstein came out of
him in Africa, in Côte d'Ivoire,

354
00:25:47,395 --> 00:25:54,295
whatever it is, one of those
Western African countries

355
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,000
hotbeds. And he was there
because he was helping them

356
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:06,760
install a system to track and
control everybody. Basically a

357
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:12,340
Palantir. He was using this war
zone and this undemocratic

358
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:17,200
dictatorship to install and test
hardware and software that the

359
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,465
CIA developed with Elon Musk
with with asshole Peter Thiel,

360
00:26:22,885 --> 00:26:25,945
with Jeffrey Epstein, with
Gordon Getty, with the whole

361
00:26:25,945 --> 00:26:31,225
fucking gang, and they tested it
back there. What more do you

362
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:35,545
fucking need? There's Palantir,
way back when, there's Elon,

363
00:26:35,545 --> 00:26:39,985
there's there's fucking Larry
Ellison, there's Microsoft.

364
00:26:39,985 --> 00:26:42,670
There's every single one of
them, every single one of them

365
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:46,630
connected to Epstein, why did
they go there not just to fuck

366
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:50,410
children? Fucking children was
the bonus. They went there to

367
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:54,130
talk about their world
domination and their satanic

368
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:59,710
club that they belonged in.
That's why they were there. They

369
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:07,915
were implementing policy, long
term strategic policy designed

370
00:27:07,915 --> 00:27:14,875
to control and implement your
death, but you don't have to go

371
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:18,475
along with it. You could help
me. You could stop fucking with

372
00:27:18,475 --> 00:27:23,275
me. You can make this your life.
You know I'm sorry if you don't

373
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:28,840
like my attitude, I'm sorry to
all the people that think I'm

374
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:34,780
just a fucking grumpy, angry old
fucking man, maybe I fucking AM.

375
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,220
If you lost everything, if you
gave up everything for a bunch

376
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:45,100
of ungrateful retards. And you
know what I do? Appreciate all

377
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,980
of you that have been helping me
so much. And yes, we've actually

378
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,725
did have a few new people
joining the group. Hell, we're

379
00:27:50,725 --> 00:27:55,645
up to, what is it? 7515 or
something. Last time I looked

380
00:27:55,645 --> 00:27:59,185
up, we've looked at it, we we've
gone up over 50 or something

381
00:27:59,185 --> 00:28:03,025
like that. So I know something's
going on. My God, maybe the fact

382
00:28:03,085 --> 00:28:05,545
that they're actually saying
Gordon Getty his name in the

383
00:28:05,545 --> 00:28:10,285
fucking Washington that should
give you a clue, people, that

384
00:28:10,285 --> 00:28:13,330
this shit is coming down, and
ultimately it's all going to

385
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:20,890
lead back to the one weak link,
the weak link in the House of

386
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:25,870
Cards, as I like to say with my
mixed metaphors. Yep, that's my

387
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,450
original Getty mixed metaphor,
right there. Weak link in the

388
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:32,770
House of Cards. Anyway, people,
I'm disgusted, yeah? People I

389
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:35,830
want to give up. Yeah, I've had
enough of it. What more can I

390
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:39,715
lose? You know, apparently I
can't even lose my life, but I

391
00:28:39,715 --> 00:28:45,415
gotta be bitter. I'd love to,
well, I'm getting a little bit

392
00:28:45,415 --> 00:28:49,135
of satisfaction. But, you know,
this, this revenge stuff? No,

393
00:28:49,855 --> 00:28:53,275
this, this is not sharp spying
to me. Yeah, sure. I mean, when

394
00:28:53,275 --> 00:28:58,435
I, when I read this message
between Gordon Getty, you know,

395
00:28:58,435 --> 00:29:02,440
indirectly, and Jeffrey Epstein
and and talking about Donald

396
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,260
Trump being a sociopath, and
referring to them all as being a

397
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,980
member of a big club, a tribe.
It's like when George Carlin

398
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,260
said, it's a big club, and you
ain't in it. You know what? It's

399
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:16,600
a big tribe, and you ain't in
it. Okay? Now, those of you that

400
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,580
were born in the tribe, like I
try to tell you all, it's not

401
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:24,445
everyone in the tribe that's
responsible. It's just like the

402
00:29:24,445 --> 00:29:27,505
CIA. There's good, conscientious
people. The CIA,

403
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,800
there's good, conscientious
police officers. They're all

404
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,540
over the place. Laura sent me
fucking food. I got a I got a

405
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:39,360
roast in there. I don't know how
many pounds. It's pretty big.

406
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,820
We're gonna cook it up tomorrow
night. Jose's gonna come over

407
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:48,120
here, beef for days anyway, and
lots of other fun stuff. The

408
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,445
ginger, you sent me a bunch of
ginger. I don't know what to get

409
00:29:50,445 --> 00:29:53,685
to with that, but I'll figure
something else, something out

410
00:29:54,165 --> 00:29:59,745
that's ginger for a year. I
mean, hell anyway, sorry for the

411
00:29:59,745 --> 00:30:04,425
dog. Version. Did I mention I
was disgusted people? Seriously,

412
00:30:06,105 --> 00:30:08,265
it's amazing I even have
anything to talk to you about,

413
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:12,825
but I don't like repeating
myself. I really don't, and I

414
00:30:12,825 --> 00:30:16,170
certainly don't write this stuff
down. I don't prepare speeches

415
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:19,350
for you. I don't prepare shows.
It's not like I'm having some

416
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,870
guests that's going to come here
and talk and I'm going to ask

417
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:24,570
questions. Mm, questions. Give
me a list of the questions you

418
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:27,270
want me to ask you before you
get here. I mean, come on, man,

419
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:32,910
like this information here about
Epstein and and Donald Trump,

420
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:37,515
his, his, I mean, come on. The
Club says Donald Trump's a

421
00:30:37,515 --> 00:30:40,755
psychopath, but he's a useful
psychopath that they can throw

422
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,215
under the bus because they've
got dirt on him, and he

423
00:30:43,215 --> 00:30:46,515
intimidates everybody, you know,
like I said, he's all full of

424
00:30:46,515 --> 00:30:51,435
bluster. He's all full of
bluster. But you know what that

425
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:58,695
facade is failing away. My God,
it's so bad. It's so bad. Can I?

426
00:30:58,695 --> 00:31:00,795
You know, seriously, I I don't.
I didn't want to do a show

427
00:31:00,795 --> 00:31:05,340
tonight. Seriously, I mentioned
that I really didn't want to do

428
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,740
a show. I figure if I do do a
show, it's just gonna be short

429
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,980
because I'm like, I said, I'm so
disgusted. But I do need to get

430
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,560
this information out. And the
only thing that's really

431
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,640
beneficial about all of this is
that the very fact that this did

432
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,180
come out, even though the media
is trying to distort it and try

433
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,285
to make it look like somehow
Gordon Getty is calling Trump a

434
00:31:24,285 --> 00:31:29,025
psychopath. Is a good thing, you
know, kind of like saying only

435
00:31:29,025 --> 00:31:31,845
Republicans now are defending
the pedophiles. Remember when it

436
00:31:31,845 --> 00:31:35,565
was the other way around? Huh?
When, when Obama was in office

437
00:31:35,565 --> 00:31:39,225
and Hillary was the big
pedophile? Now suddenly it's the

438
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:43,365
hits the Republicans. Seriously,
people, have you fallen for this

439
00:31:43,365 --> 00:31:47,370
shit? You fucking retarded. And
this disgusts me, and I've had

440
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:54,990
enough of it anyway. All right,
once again, if you, if you do

441
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,810
want to, I, you know, I don't
even know where the watch this

442
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:00,450
video, because I don't put these
things up, and Cynthia isn't

443
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:04,230
putting them up anymore because
she's upset about my my Steven D

444
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:09,075
Kelly soap opera show, and I
hope she'll get over it, but

445
00:32:09,855 --> 00:32:12,375
hope she'll get back on the
mission. Because obviously, I'm

446
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:17,415
not the mission. I'm sorry. You
know I'm I like Rambo said.

447
00:32:17,415 --> 00:32:20,475
Rambo actually told me to use
whatever I have to try to get

448
00:32:20,475 --> 00:32:25,695
people motivated. You know,
Rambo said, he goes. He says, My

449
00:32:25,695 --> 00:32:28,515
I mean, I'm not following his
instructions very well. I try to

450
00:32:28,515 --> 00:32:31,740
a little bit. But he said, work
out. Obviously. Said, workout.

451
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:37,980
I'm not doing that. Obviously I
should be, but I'm not. He said

452
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,840
to grow my beard out. He said,
to wear black clothing. Wear

453
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,600
only black clothing. I do that
anyway. I'm not right. I don't

454
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,600
grow my beard out, but. But he
thought if I grew my beard out,

455
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,360
wore black clothing and got all
steadily worked out, I guess I'd

456
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,505
look like Dan Bilzerian, but
maybe a little taller than Dan

457
00:32:56,505 --> 00:33:01,005
Bilzerian, but. But the idea
that was that this was supposed

458
00:33:01,005 --> 00:33:04,725
to help me influence people to
the cause. And the idea was it

459
00:33:04,725 --> 00:33:07,725
was supposed to make all the men
want to be my friends, and all

460
00:33:07,725 --> 00:33:13,425
the women want to be my special
friend. That's just how it is.

461
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:17,205
That's the dynamics of the human
human nature. What I found

462
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:22,110
actually, is that when I'm most
effective is when I have a

463
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:25,830
female counterpart, you know, a
complimentary female

464
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:30,450
counterpart, who will actually
balance that energy out. Because

465
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:37,890
I In an ideal situation, the
power couple are both desirable,

466
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,470
if you will. I mean the men all
want the woman, the women all

467
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:43,455
want the man that that's the
ultimate power couple. The men

468
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:46,335
all want to be friends with the
man, and the women all want to

469
00:33:46,335 --> 00:33:48,975
be friends with a woman. You
know, it's, it's, that's the

470
00:33:48,975 --> 00:33:53,235
ultimate power couple. I could
think of some throughout

471
00:33:53,235 --> 00:33:56,055
history, but Anthony and
Cleopatra, there you go. There's

472
00:33:56,055 --> 00:34:00,195
a power couple. But anyway, so,
yeah, to achieve that in life is

473
00:34:00,195 --> 00:34:03,135
certainly a good thing if you're
trying to do a mission like

474
00:34:03,135 --> 00:34:08,400
this. But unfortunately, I'm I'm
doing it the best I can with

475
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,040
what I have, and I'm
appreciative of all you guys's

476
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,860
efforts. You know, seriously,
the memes and stuff, people

477
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,860
still ask me. Jones sent me
messages. Who does your videos?

478
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:20,400
Well, I do my videos, such as
they are, but it's up to other

479
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,240
people to post these things. You
know, if you want to help this

480
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,980
mission and you don't know what
to do, start a YouTube page. I

481
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,965
mean, if you put my stuff on
YouTube, chances are they'll cut

482
00:34:31,965 --> 00:34:35,205
cut it off. I mean, my God, you
imagine I'd probably have 15

483
00:34:35,205 --> 00:34:40,125
million viewers or subscribers
if I wasn't censored. But

484
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:45,465
anyway, I am censored and I am
cut off. But if, but they can't

485
00:34:45,465 --> 00:34:49,425
stop us all. So if a million of
you all open up pages on rumble

486
00:34:49,425 --> 00:34:52,050
and YouTube and Brighton or
whatever, and you saturate the

487
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,750
place with these silly videos. I
mean, I know you got which ones

488
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:57,690
apart. I just want to post the
important ones. No, you got to

489
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:01,230
post them all. You got to
archive it all. All because I

490
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,870
can't do it. As soon as I do it,
they'll shut it down. I'm too

491
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,690
busy trying to create the
content. I can't worry about

492
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:10,350
producing it and distributing
it. I need your help anyway,

493
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,930
again, thanks to all the people
that are working so hard in the

494
00:35:12,975 --> 00:35:17,115
group, because obviously I can't
do it alone. And you're the

495
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:20,055
reason why so many people know
about this stuff and why we're

496
00:35:20,055 --> 00:35:26,235
getting to where we are. There's
one thing, though, I want to

497
00:35:26,235 --> 00:35:30,555
leave you with. I don't worry we
got a long ways to go, but one

498
00:35:30,555 --> 00:35:34,875
of the things that Trump's doing
right now that I obviously I'm

499
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:38,340
extremely disgusted about,
because, as I mentioned

500
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,800
previously, there's three things
in my life that I need, that are

501
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,720
being slowly taken away from me.
Let me see. Can you remember

502
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,780
what they are? One of them's
food, one of them sex. What's

503
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:55,320
the other one? Pot? Well, Trump,
Trump, Trump. Trump wants to

504
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:02,265
make THC illegal. What the THC
illegal? It just, it's, it's

505
00:36:02,265 --> 00:36:05,265
booming. Why? What the hell. But
they're not saying earlier.

506
00:36:05,265 --> 00:36:07,845
They're calling it hemp product.
We want to make hemp product

507
00:36:07,845 --> 00:36:10,905
legal. Hemp products. What do
you want to do? A hemp product

508
00:36:10,905 --> 00:36:16,065
is a rope. It's a canvas sale,
it's a bag. It's canvas. That's,

509
00:36:16,065 --> 00:36:23,550
that's a hemp product. We don't
smoke hemp products. Hemp is

510
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:31,410
fiber, okay? The bud is the
flower. It's not hemp flower.

511
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:36,810
Not smoking hemp flower. We're
smoking cannabis sativa. It's

512
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:41,730
not marijuana. It's not hemp.
It's Cannabis sativa, the

513
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:46,770
psychoactive ingredient, the
active ingredient, which cures

514
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:49,935
cancer. Fucking shit. It's,
there's a patent on it, it cures

515
00:36:49,935 --> 00:36:56,715
cancer. Holy shit, it's THC. Now
there are variations of THC, and

516
00:36:56,715 --> 00:37:00,915
because of the recent
legalization, the biology and

517
00:37:00,915 --> 00:37:04,455
the work that's being done with
the different strains they're

518
00:37:04,635 --> 00:37:08,040
they're coming up with
incredible products, you know,

519
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,300
isolating terpenes and getting,
you know, analyze, you know,

520
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,020
CBD, CBD oils and what have you.
I mean, my God, if you have a

521
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:23,700
brain seizure, you take CBD. I'm
serious, that's how you stop a

522
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:30,180
brain seizure. See, I don't know
anything else to tell you. Hell,

523
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,405
I had a dog was having brain
seizures. She died, of course,

524
00:37:33,765 --> 00:37:37,125
but I did would do anything to
try to relieve some of the agony

525
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:39,405
that dog was going through. And
the only thing that would help

526
00:37:39,405 --> 00:37:46,305
was CBD. I gave it to our 5000
milligram dosages, concentrated

527
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:53,925
stuff. I would do it again in a
heartbeat. Anyway. The point is,

528
00:37:53,925 --> 00:37:58,830
is that this is real, live
medicine. And of course, the

529
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:01,530
pharmaceutical industry doesn't
like this, because, yes, it's

530
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:06,150
become a multi billion hell,
just the edibles alone, the

531
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,210
product you know, the products
that are being sold food,

532
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:13,230
products that are being sold
here in California that have a

533
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:19,155
THC, additives, you know, made
from concentrates, are it's a

534
00:38:19,155 --> 00:38:22,155
billion dollar industry. It's
fast approaching a multi billion

535
00:38:22,155 --> 00:38:24,435
dollar industry and and we
always wondered how the

536
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:27,555
monsantos and the crafts and
these big, giant food

537
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,735
conglomerates, these agro
industry giants, were going to

538
00:38:30,735 --> 00:38:34,335
keep up with these, these little
growers that are operating in

539
00:38:35,175 --> 00:38:39,960
warehouses all over the country,
at least the state here. Well

540
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,880
anyway, what are they doing?
They're adding billions of

541
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,620
dollars to the state's economy.
And of course, California, it's

542
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,620
a big it's a big deal. And all
the other states will get on,

543
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:54,960
get in on it. And they are. Here
comes Trump. I mean seriously,

544
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,840
Trump, are you fucking senile?
What's the real reason for doing

545
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:02,580
this? Well, obviously, the
pharmaceutical companies are in

546
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:03,225
trouble

547
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:08,040
with their mRNA drugs and their
inability to try to inflict

548
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,940
covid upon everybody. That was a
big failure. And of course, the

549
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,240
2040, whatever it is, trillion
dollars of debt that the United

550
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,560
States owes it goes to directly
to supporting the pharmaceutical

551
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:23,460
bullshit, which, of course, is
under the control of the mafias.

552
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:29,445
It's just one branch of the
mafia, you know, add in the

553
00:39:29,445 --> 00:39:35,505
stock market, banking,
insurance, and, of course,

554
00:39:35,505 --> 00:39:40,245
Hollywood, you know, you've that
kind of thing, the media empire.

555
00:39:40,605 --> 00:39:43,905
Those are the branches of what
controls us, the mafia. But

556
00:39:43,905 --> 00:39:46,965
anyway, so, yeah,
pharmaceuticals are shitting

557
00:39:46,965 --> 00:39:50,370
their pants. But you know, what
is the real reason when they're

558
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:52,710
really worried about this pot?
Well, you know, here's the

559
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:57,750
thing, as I said in the last
show, the little hats are

560
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:02,970
freaking out because the. Uh,
you know, the kingdom of little

561
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:08,790
hats. It depends on controlling
people and keeping them stupid

562
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:11,730
and keeping them programmed, and
they work really hard to do this

563
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:16,275
to everybody from a really
early, early stage. Now, there

564
00:40:16,275 --> 00:40:20,655
is one thing that breaks
programming. And if you've ever

565
00:40:20,655 --> 00:40:26,595
talked to anybody who was MK
Ultra or this sort of thing, or,

566
00:40:26,595 --> 00:40:30,015
you know, Mylab military
abduction, they will tell you

567
00:40:30,735 --> 00:40:34,155
that the programming that they
subject you to, which is usually

568
00:40:34,155 --> 00:40:40,020
psychotropic drugs and stuff
like that, is defeated with pot

569
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:46,620
THC defeats it ends it stops it.
It's like a light switch. The

570
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:50,280
brain goes, Wait a minute. Why
in the hell did I believe all

571
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,100
that bullshit for all those
years? What in the hell was that

572
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,580
all about? It's very confusing.
It's kind of like when you die

573
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,625
and you spent three years in
darkness, and during that time,

574
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:03,285
you're getting downloaded the
entire Akashic records, and that

575
00:41:03,285 --> 00:41:06,945
whole time, you're going, what
the fuck you know, kind of like

576
00:41:06,945 --> 00:41:12,945
I said I was doing when I
realized that 20 years they've

577
00:41:12,945 --> 00:41:15,225
been doing this shit right in
front of my face. I'm just now

578
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:18,465
figuring it out, and I'm trying
to share it with you guys to

579
00:41:18,465 --> 00:41:21,705
give you a 20 year head start,
and it's only going to happen if

580
00:41:21,705 --> 00:41:29,610
you actually listen to me, but I
I first got exposed to pot in

581
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:33,630
when I was, like 13 years old.
And I know I don't recommend

582
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:38,250
this, because pot does have
estrogen promotion, and that's

583
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:40,410
not good for young men. You
know, when they're growing up,

584
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:44,130
you don't want to be giving boys
anything has anything to do with

585
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,675
estrogen. It's like soy. Don't
give your children your male

586
00:41:45,675 --> 00:41:49,215
children soy. Give it to your
girls. But no, in fact, you're

587
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:52,815
going to give anything to your
boys. Give them beef, red beef.

588
00:41:52,815 --> 00:41:56,775
It's got male hormone in it.
Okay? Milk, well, milk has

589
00:41:56,775 --> 00:42:01,695
growth hormone, but it's bovine
growth hormone, but it over

590
00:42:01,815 --> 00:42:06,015
chicken has a lot of female
estrogen in it anyway. Point is,

591
00:42:06,015 --> 00:42:10,920
is that when I was 13, I was in
Catholic school still, and I

592
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,700
when I got woke up and I'm like,
oh my god, suddenly none of it

593
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,120
made sense. Did not fit in
anymore. And then I went to

594
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:22,080
public school, and guess what?
It didn't make sense there

595
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,380
either everything. I had to redo
everything. I mean, that's when

596
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,800
it really started, when you
started questioning everything,

597
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,800
when you start when I that's
when I realized that everybody

598
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,085
was really kind of stupid. I
realized my teachers were

599
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:38,565
stupid. I realized a lot of
things, you know, I mean, some

600
00:42:38,565 --> 00:42:41,265
things it took a long time to
realize, like, like, all my

601
00:42:41,265 --> 00:42:44,925
female teachers were, I wouldn't
say they're molested me. Well,

602
00:42:44,925 --> 00:42:47,385
let's just say they, mostly,
most of them, loved me when I

603
00:42:47,385 --> 00:42:49,785
was going through the Catholic
school. I mean, even the nuns,

604
00:42:49,785 --> 00:42:53,910
the nuns would have me sitting
on their lap. But the only

605
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:57,210
teacher that didn't like me was
my first grade teacher, and she

606
00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:01,950
was a lesbian, but her partner
was my second grade teacher, and

607
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:06,570
she did like me. So hey, what
can I say? Right? I guess one

608
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:09,390
was Butch and the other one was
not so Butch and the not so

609
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:15,510
Butch liked me. So funny how
that stuff works anyway. Such is

610
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:16,353
life. Alright, listen, guys, I
do again, like I said, want to

611
00:43:16,353 --> 00:43:16,815
thank all you people that helped
me with the mission and people

612
00:43:16,815 --> 00:43:24,015
are trying to help me. Trying to
help me, give me motivation to

613
00:43:24,015 --> 00:43:26,415
hang in there, you know, like
eating and stuff. Yeah, eating

614
00:43:26,415 --> 00:43:28,695
is important. And yeah, I'm
trying to eat and blah, blah,

615
00:43:28,695 --> 00:43:34,575
blah. And, yeah, it is nice
having food around, although I

616
00:43:34,575 --> 00:43:38,595
don't have any idea what I'm
going to do with all that

617
00:43:38,595 --> 00:43:39,199
ginger, Laura, but you'll have
to send me some recipes. But if

618
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:44,640
you'd want to help me out. Of
course, financially, it's Yahoo

619
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,840
or not Yahoo, but PayPal. PayPal

620
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:52,740
That's s, t, e, v, e, n, k, e,
Lk, e, l, l, e, y, 7, 1,

621
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:56,640
4@yahoo.com and you have safe
for your family. And I did get a

622
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,020
couple donations from a couple
people. I'm not gonna say her

623
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,931
name. One guy sent me, I think
it was 10 bucks. Another one

624
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:04,089
sent me 20. I think just
recently, pretty sure it was 20.

625
00:44:04,089 --> 00:44:10,725
I don't think it's more than
that, but anyway, I try to send

626
00:44:10,905 --> 00:44:15,705
thank yous back when you do
that. But sometimes they make me

627
00:44:15,705 --> 00:44:20,445
have to sign in to PayPal to do
it. PayPal makes me, like, jump

628
00:44:20,445 --> 00:44:23,685
through hoops like, like, send a
code to my cell phone. I don't

629
00:44:23,685 --> 00:44:26,070
have a cell phone. I'm using
someone else's cell phone, just

630
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:29,550
like I'm using someone else's
bank account just to have a damn

631
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:35,550
PayPal at all. Okay, so it just
be it, be it. No, don't think

632
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:39,150
that just because I have a
PayPal that I've got, like, you

633
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:41,430
know, credit cards and
everything else I don't

634
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:46,290
seriously. I was, I was, I'm a
broke joke. But that doesn't

635
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:49,995
mean I won't send you something
if you need it, all right,

636
00:44:50,115 --> 00:44:53,955
anyway. So, yeah, help me out if
you can. But of course, the most

637
00:44:53,955 --> 00:44:57,675
thing, helpful thing that you
can do is, like I said, share

638
00:44:57,675 --> 00:45:02,115
these videos. Join the group. I.
Telegram, which is this, occupy

639
00:45:02,115 --> 00:45:04,875
the Getty slash Steven D Kelley
group. And remember the occupy

640
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:09,555
the Getty thing. It's not going
away. That slogan, whether you

641
00:45:09,555 --> 00:45:12,135
like it or not, you think, Well,
what does this occupy? The thing

642
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,880
that sounds violent, that's so
it doesn't matter what it sounds

643
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,180
like anymore. What the original
intention of it, what it is, is

644
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:24,360
our flag. Okay, people, it's our
flag. The reasoning for why that

645
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:28,740
flag was created may become a
little blurry as time goes on,

646
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:32,040
but it doesn't matter, because
the point is that this is a flag

647
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,160
that is established and
recognized, and it's only a

648
00:45:35,205 --> 00:45:42,405
matter of time before we are
talked about in a less

649
00:45:42,405 --> 00:45:45,525
disparaging way. It's like if
you ask grok about me right now,

650
00:45:45,525 --> 00:45:47,985
of course, grok has been
reprogrammed so many times you

651
00:45:47,985 --> 00:45:53,385
can't keep up with it, but grok
will tell you that I'm a file

652
00:45:53,385 --> 00:45:56,145
grock will say, there's no
evidence. There's no evidence.

653
00:45:57,285 --> 00:46:02,490
Everything I say is BS, it's,
it's conspiracy. Never minded

654
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:06,090
Gordon gay and Epstein and all
these people are just calling

655
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:09,090
Donald Trump a psychopath, like
he's a crazy child that they

656
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:15,990
want to take advantage of who
they do. And yet, you all think

657
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:18,630
he's fucking wonderful. I can't
believe it's like I said. I'm

658
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:21,210
disgusted when I see him walking
around the White House with that

659
00:46:21,255 --> 00:46:25,455
gold he has all over the place.
Oh my god. Everybody made a joke

660
00:46:25,455 --> 00:46:27,975
and said that when he became
president, he was going to put

661
00:46:27,975 --> 00:46:32,055
gold all over the place. He
fucking did. What more do you

662
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:38,655
need? The proof that this is an
ungodly man who mocks us, who

663
00:46:38,655 --> 00:46:45,600
mocks us openly. They don't
care. They just don't care. You

664
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:50,640
know what they do care about?
They care about the Getty. They

665
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,520
care about me. They care about
what I'm doing. You want to fuck

666
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,940
them over? You want to fuck this
government? Well, if you don't

667
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,520
want to fuck this government,
you might as well become a

668
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,660
pedophile and suck Satan's cock
and be like them. But if you

669
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:07,080
want that shit to end, if you
want to be a responsible human,

670
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:11,145
that when you go to heaven, you
don't have to answer to God all

671
00:47:11,145 --> 00:47:14,385
those excuses that you made for
ignoring the things I'm trying

672
00:47:14,385 --> 00:47:17,925
to tell you right now, if you
want to be that person, then

673
00:47:17,925 --> 00:47:23,265
help me out. Find ways to help
me out. Use your skills, use

674
00:47:23,265 --> 00:47:26,805
whatever circle of friends you
have, use whatever resources you

675
00:47:26,805 --> 00:47:30,990
have, find a way. Make an
effort. That's That's all we're

676
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:35,010
asking. Okay, make an effort.
Serve others, and this is great

677
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:38,610
way to do it. Okay, I've devoted
my life to it, and I don't

678
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:44,970
expect you to do that. But if I
don't expect my my contribution,

679
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:47,790
my sacrifice, to be a waste
either, I already know that I

680
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:51,210
win this battle, but I'd like it
to be done sooner than later,

681
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:55,095
and I know that if it takes
longer to do this, and more

682
00:47:55,095 --> 00:47:58,095
people have to suffer before it
gets done, and then I'm flaking

683
00:47:58,095 --> 00:48:02,415
out. So that's why it's
important to me to hang in there

684
00:48:03,615 --> 00:48:07,215
and harass you guys and do
everything I can to try to get

685
00:48:07,215 --> 00:48:13,695
you to help me okay? And that
doesn't mean I'm going to kiss

686
00:48:13,755 --> 00:48:15,699
your ass, and that doesn't mean
I'm looking for you to kiss my

687
00:48:15,699 --> 00:48:15,886
ass. The only people are going
to be kissing my ass are those

688
00:48:15,886 --> 00:48:19,260
people that I spare from having
their heads cut off because they

689
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:23,280
have been helping enable this
satanic pedophilia for all these

690
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,160
years. And you know who you are?
Just like those FBI

691
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,280
motherfuckers who ran out of my
front yard and me yelling at

692
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,460
them, you are pedophile
enablers, because that is

693
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:37,140
exactly what they are, Kash,
Patel, all of them, they're all

694
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,305
fucking pedophiles, that tribe,
that club, that Epstein's

695
00:48:40,305 --> 00:48:44,805
talking about pedophiles. If you
can't see that, there's

696
00:48:44,805 --> 00:48:48,645
something wrong with you, if you
think that's okay, there's

697
00:48:48,645 --> 00:48:55,425
something wrong with you. If you
won't help me, there's something

698
00:48:55,425 --> 00:49:00,465
wrong with you. If you think
that you need more proof,

699
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:05,633
in spite of the fact that
they're even talking about this

700
00:49:05,699 --> 00:49:09,245
connection right now, Getty's
his name is coming up in

701
00:49:09,311 --> 00:49:13,383
connection to Epstein right now.
If that's not good enough for

702
00:49:13,448 --> 00:49:17,323
you, I don't know what more you
need, considering that they

703
00:49:17,389 --> 00:49:21,395
won't even talk about Epstein
yet. Now we've got Getty's name

704
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:25,204
connected to Epstein, with
Epstein calling it a big club,

705
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:29,145
with Getty being the patriarch
figure, my God, people, it's

706
00:49:29,211 --> 00:49:33,020
right in front of your face.
Someday, you're going to look

707
00:49:33,086 --> 00:49:37,026
back on everything I've been
saying for all these years. You

708
00:49:37,092 --> 00:49:41,164
know, fucking a it was in front
of our face all that time, and

709
00:49:41,229 --> 00:49:45,170
it was, and that's my job, is
making sure that it is. That's

710
00:49:45,236 --> 00:49:49,307
all I can do. And I'd like to
think that I'm doing my job. And

711
00:49:49,373 --> 00:49:53,117
I'd like to think that maybe,
maybe I've done my job good

712
00:49:53,182 --> 00:49:57,320
enough to earn my place where it
should be. And to get the hell

713
00:49:57,386 --> 00:50:01,326
off this rock with all my sins
forgiven, God willing, that's

714
00:50:01,392 --> 00:50:05,398
the best any of us could hope
for. Alright, so with that, I'm

715
00:50:05,464 --> 00:50:09,601
just going to remind you again
that my name is Steven D Kelley.

716
00:50:09,667 --> 00:50:13,542
Thank you for listening, you
guys over there, tin foil hat,

717
00:50:13,607 --> 00:50:17,811
if you made it this long, right
on, talk to you later. And guys,

718
00:50:17,876 --> 00:50:21,817
I'm not in your group to sell
the page. I'm in there because

719
00:50:21,883 --> 00:50:25,560
you can talk shit and we can
talk shit. Nobody gets butt

720
00:50:25,626 --> 00:50:29,829
hurt. It's like, nice not having
an admin, huh? On my group, you

721
00:50:29,895 --> 00:50:34,098
can't do that anyway. So that's
why it's nice. If you wonder why

722
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:38,105
I'm there and what, what, what
I'm doing, that's, that's why

723
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:42,242
I'm there. It's, it's for you
guys. It's because we all harass

724
00:50:42,308 --> 00:50:46,445
each other. Anyway, such is life
right now, right? We're in the

725
00:50:46,511 --> 00:50:50,386
mean wars in the kingdom of the
little hats, right? Anyway,

726
00:50:50,452 --> 00:50:54,524
folks, once again, my name is
Steven D Kelley, and this is the

727
00:50:54,589 --> 00:50:58,661
Steven D Kelley show, and we are
truth, cat radio, the one and

728
00:50:58,727 --> 00:51:02,667
only. And God, I'll tell you,
Mr. Kitten, I don't know. He's

729
00:51:02,733 --> 00:51:07,002
getting old. He's like me. We're
both getting old and skinny, and

730
00:51:07,068 --> 00:51:11,140
I just scares the shit out of me
people. I don't like thinking

731
00:51:11,205 --> 00:51:15,211
about mortality. I'll tell you
one thing about it. I hope you

732
00:51:15,277 --> 00:51:18,889
guys can scrape enough money
together to get me buried.

733
00:51:18,955 --> 00:51:23,027
Seriously, I don't want to get
cremated. End up in a box on my

734
00:51:23,093 --> 00:51:26,836
side. I want to be buried. I
want to have the ashes of my

735
00:51:26,902 --> 00:51:31,039
kitty cats with me, and I have a
stuffed rabbit from, you know,

736
00:51:31,105 --> 00:51:35,111
when I was like, what five I'd
like to have that with me sits

737
00:51:35,177 --> 00:51:38,789
next to my bed. You know, of
course, whatever my Rolex,

738
00:51:38,855 --> 00:51:42,992
whatever, you can keep that and
give it to someone. I'll have a

739
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:47,064
giveaway my meager possessions.
But seriously, people, right.

740
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:51,202
Okay, do you understand I think
about things like that. Oh, my

741

dinner's here. Alright, once
again, my name is Steven Kelley.
